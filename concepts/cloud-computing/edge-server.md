# Edge Server

A CDN ([[content-delivery-network]]) edge server is a computer that exists at the logical extreme or “edge” of a network. An edge server often serves as the connection between separate networks. A primary purpose of a CDN edge server is to store content as close as possible to a requesting client machine, thereby reducing latency and improving page load times.
