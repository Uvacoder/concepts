# Varnish Cache

Varnish [[cache]] is a web application accelerator, also known as a caching HTTP [[reverse-proxy]], but rather an accelerator installed in front of an HTTP origin server. Varnish's configuration decides what content should be served from Varnish, and how the request or response should be altered.
