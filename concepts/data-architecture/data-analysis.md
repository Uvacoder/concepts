# Data Analysis

Data analysis refers to the process of examining, transforming and arranging a given data set in specific ways in order to study its individual parts and extract useful information. [[data-analytics]] is an overarching science or discipline that encompasses the complete management of data.

## Stages of data analysis

### 1. **Understand the data model**

- It is the duty of the data analyst to understand the way how the data is stored and also of what it consists
- Data usually is segregated in multiple tables, so a deep level of understanding of how they connect one to another is necessary

### 2. **Manipulate the data**

- Data manipulation can be done either with [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) or using other programming languages such as [Java](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)>), [Python](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)>), etc.
- It can involve both aggregating / joining existing models but also creating new ones to facilitate easier interrogation
- Some type of [[etl]] process may be involved if data is distributed on multiple [[database]]. The data analyst might not be involved in the actual implementation of the process, but would work with the framework to ensure that the data is available for interrogation
- It may also involve some [[data-cleansing]] to make sure the data are complete and accurate.

### 3. **Presenting insights from the data**

- Data analyses have as output key insights from the data that can be easily consumed and are self-explanatory
- The key insights can be displayed in reporting and dashboard with [[data-visualization]] tools.
- The insights from the data can be served to other systems that will use the output of the analysis for further integration/investigation such as ML models, advanced reporting systems, E-mail send-outs etc.
