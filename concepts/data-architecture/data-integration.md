# Data Integration

Data integration is the process of combining data from different sources into a single, unified view. Integration begins with the ingestion process, and includes steps such as [[data-cleansing]], [[etl]] mapping, and transformation.

Data integration encompasses [[data-replication]] processes while also emphasizing the breaking down of data silosâ€”combining different types of data from multiple data sources including [[database]], [[data-warehouse]], and legacy systems into a common format and repository.
