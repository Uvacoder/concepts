# Extract, Load & Transform (ELT)

In the ELT approach, after you’ve extracted your data, you immediately start the loading phase - moving all the data sources into a single, centralized data repository ([[data-lake]]). With today’s infrastructure technologies using the cloud, systems can now support large storage and scalable compute. Therefore, a large, expanding data pool and fast processing is virtually endless for maintaining all the extracted raw data.

In this way, the ELT approach provides a modern alternative to [[etl]]. However, it’s still evolving. Therefore, the frameworks and tools to support the ELT process are not always fully developed to facilitate load and processing of large amount of data. The upside is very promising - enabling unlimited access to all of your data at any time and saving developers efforts and time for BI users and analysts.
