# OWASP

The Open Web Application Security Project, or OWASP, is an international non-profit organization dedicated to web application security ([[software-dev-security]]). One of OWASP’s core principles is that all of their materials be freely available and easily accessible on their website, making it possible for anyone to improve their own web application security. The materials they offer include documentation, tools, videos, and forums. Perhaps their best-known project is the OWASP Top 10.

## OWASP Top 10

The OWASP Top 10 is a regularly-updated report outlining security concerns for web application security, focusing on the 10 most critical risks. The report is put together by a team of security experts from all over the world. OWASP refers to the Top 10 as an ‘awareness document’ and they recommend that all companies incorporate the report into their processes in order to minimize and/or mitigate security risks.

Below are the security risks reported in the OWASP Top 10 2017 report:

1. Injection (SQL injection attack)
2. Broken Authentication
3. Sensitive Data Exposure
4. XML External Entities (XEE)
5. Broken Access Control
6. Security Misconfiguration
7. Cross-Site Scripting
8. Insecure Deserialization
9. Using Components With Known Vulnerabilities
10. Insufficient Logging And Monitoring
