# Continuous Delivery (CD)

Continuous Delivery is the practice of keeping your codebase deployable at any point. Beyond making sure your application passes automated tests it has to have all the configuration (leveraging [[feature-toggle]]) necessary to push it into production. Many teams then do push changes that pass the automated tests into a test or production environment immediately to ensure a fast development loop.
