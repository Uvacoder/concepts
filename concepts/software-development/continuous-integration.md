# Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository([[version-control]]) frequently, preferably several times a day. Each integration can then be verified by an automated build and automated tests. While automated testing is not strictly part of CI it is typically implied.

## Examples

- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)
- [Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/)
- [[spinnaker]]

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[version-control]: version-control "Version Control"
[spinnaker]: ../cloud-computing/spinnaker "Spinnaker"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
