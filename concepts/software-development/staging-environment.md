# Staging Environment

A staging environment (stage) is a nearly exact replica ([[data-replication]]) of a production environment for software testing. Staging environments are made to test codes, builds, and updates to ensure quality under a production-like environment before application deployment.

Usually, as part of the [[continuous-delivery]] pipeline, new code will be deployed to staging for testing before going to production.
